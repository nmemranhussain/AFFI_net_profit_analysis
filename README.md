# Unlocking Insights of AFFI using ANOVA, ANACOVA & Scheffe Test Analysis with Confounding Effects
Aristocrats Food Franchise Inc. (AFFI), which operates during home games of the Washington Aristocrats baseball club. Due to its small scale, AFFI offers one of four food-beverage combinations (Combo1, Combo2, Combo3, Combo4) at each game. The goal is to determine whether certain combinations are more profitable than others, both independently and after accounting for the game day's temperature. The dataset includes three variables for each selected game: Combo (categorical/discreet), Temperature (continuous in Fahrenheit), and Net Profit (continuous, in thousands of dollars). Using R, the analysis employs statistical methods such as ANOVA, ANACOVA, Eta-square, and Scheffe tests to evaluate relationships and assess predictive powers. It also explores confounding effects of temperature on profit differences between combinations, providing actionable insights for optimizing AFFI's offerings. The dataset and R scripts are included for reproducibility and further exploration.
