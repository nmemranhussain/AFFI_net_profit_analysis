# Unlocking Insights of AFFI using ANOVA, ANACOVA & Scheffe Test Analysis with Confounding Effects
Aristocrats Food Franchise Inc. (AFFI) sells food and beverages at home games of the Washington Aristocrats baseball club. Because of its small size, AFFI sells only one of four possible food-beverage combinations (Combo1, Combo2, Combo3, Combo4) at any given home game. AFFI is now interested in determining whether one combination is more profitable than the others, both before and after adjusting for differences that might be attributable to the temperature on game day. A random sample of home games is selected, and for each selected game three things are recorded: the combination offered at that game (Combo: “Combo1”, “Combo2”, “Combo3”, or “Combo4”), the air temperature (Temp: in Fahrenheit degrees) at the time the game begins, and the net profit (NetProfit: in thousands of dollars) that AFFI derived from selling that particular combination at that particular game. These data are contained in the file named Aristocrats.dat, which includes a header line naming the variables in the first record.
