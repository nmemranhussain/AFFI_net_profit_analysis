# Unlocking Insights of AFFI using ANOVA, ANCOVA & Scheffe Test Analysis with Confounding Effects
Aristocrats Food Franchise Inc. (AFFI), which operates during home games of the Washington Aristocrats baseball club. Due to its small scale, AFFI offers one of four food-beverage combinations (Combo1, Combo2, Combo3, Combo4) at each game. The goal is to determine whether certain combinations are more profitable than others, both independently and after accounting for the game day's temperature. The dataset includes three variables for each selected game: Combo (categorical/discreet), Temperature (continuous in Fahrenheit), and Net Profit (continuous, in thousands of dollars). Using R, the analysis employs statistical methods such as ANOVA, ANCOVA, Eta-square, and Scheffe tests to evaluate relationships and assess predictive powers. It also explores confounding effects of temperature on profit differences between combinations, providing actionable insights for optimizing AFFI's offerings. The dataset and R scripts are included for reproducibility and further exploration.

## Intended Use
**Purpose:**
This repository is designed to analyze factors influencing net profit for Aristocrats Food Franchise Inc. (AFFI), with a focus on understanding the interplay between independent variables and their impact on regression analysis. Key objectives include:

**Exploring Confounding Effects:**  
Assess whether or not temperature confounds the relationship between food-beverage combinations and net profit, both in bivariate and multivariate analyses.
**Examining Predictor Interplay:**  
Investigate the unique and combined predictive powers of independent variables (Combo: discreet, Temperature: continuous) on the dependent variable (Net Profit).
**Model Evaluation:**  
Evaluate the explanatory power of models using ANOVA, ANCOVA, and Eta-square, examining coefficients and statistical significance.
**Actionable Insights:**  
Provide a framework for identifying and interpreting confounding hypotheses and differences in means across combinations
**Statistical Application:**  
Employ R for data analysis to demonstrate practical regression, ANOVA and ANCOVA techniques.
**Confidence Level:**  
All results are reported with a precision of four decimal places, maintaining a significance level of 0.05 for statistical tests.

**Intended Users:**
- Data Analysts, Data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, educators.

**Out-of-scope Uses:**
- The model is not intended for production use in any critical applications or real-time decision-making systems.
